* **Title:** Optimizing Joint Radio and Computing Resource Allocation in Vehicular Edge Computing.
* **Abstract:** This PhD thesis focuses on enhancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) by integrating Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC) into 5G networks to overcome the hardware limitations of individual vehicles. Since critical V2X services are highly sensitive to latency, the research leverages SDN and NFV technologies to process data at the network edge rather than in a distant cloud, thereby ensuring high bandwidth and rapid response times. The primary objective is to develop a joint resource allocation framework that efficiently manages both radio and computational resources to minimize the cumulative delay caused by transmission and processing.

* **Title:** Towards secrecy energy-efficient solutions for cooperative backscatter-aided non-orthogonal multiple access systems.
* **Abstract:** The rapid development of next-generation wireless networks comes with increasing requirements in terms of massive connectivity, energy efficiency, and secure communications. In this context, Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) has emerged as a key technology to serve multiple users simultaneously over the same spectral resources. In parallel, Ambient Backscatter Communication (AmBC) offers an energy-efficient solution by enabling passive data transmission using ambient signals. However, the open nature of the wireless channel makes these systems vulnerable to passive eavesdropping attacks, which raises the need to design robust protection  mechanisms. 
In this regard, Physical Layer Security (PLS) is an emerging paradigm that addresses this challenge by exploiting the inherent characteristics of the wireless channel, such as noise, fading, dispersion, and interference, to ensure confidentiality between legitimate users in the presence of potential eavesdroppers.
In this thesis, we study novel resource allocation strategies for maximizing the secrecy energy-efficiency (SEE) in multi-user NOMA networks, with or without ambient backscatter assistance.
First, we study a downlink NOMA system in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Assuming perfect channel state information, we formulate a bi-objective optimization problem aiming to maximize the secrecy rate while minimizing power consumption, under a total power budget and minimum rate per user constraints. We derive an exact solution for the optimal power allocation in the scalarized case, which not only characterizes all the optimal points on the Pareto boundary, but also significantly reduces the complexity of the fractional problem. In particular, when the objective is the ratio between the total secure throughput and the total consumed power, our optimal solution allows Dinkelbach’s algorithm to be reduced to a simple one-dimensional bisection search, thus avoiding any complex iterative numerical resolutions. Simulations highlight the advantage of NOMA over Orthogonal Multiple Access (OMA) in terms of the secrecy rate vs. power trade-off.
Next, we extend our study by integrating ambient backscatter devices that transmit their own data by modulating the radio signal they receive from the transmitter without emitting any active signal. In a first scenario, we consider a single fixed device acting as a passive relay. By exploiting the structure of the composite channel, we obtain an exact solution for optimal resource allocation. The study is then extended to more general configurations, including multiple cooperative devices. In this case, the problem becomes significantly more complex, making exact approaches impractical. We then propose a heuristic method based on the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, enabling the joint allocation of transmit powers and backscatter reflection coefficients. The results show that the secrecy energy-efficiency improves with the number of backscatter devices, and that the gains remain robust even in the presence of estimation errors on the eavesdropper's channel.
Finally, we develop an approach based on Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to predict optimal resource allocations in dynamic environments. A Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) is trained from reference solutions obtained from our previous contributions. To ensure interpretability, we use the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method to identify the most influential input variables. This solution reaches up to $96.2\%$ of the performance of exact optimization, while significantly reducing the computational complexity, thus providing a fast, scalable, and interpretable solution suitable for real-time systems.
