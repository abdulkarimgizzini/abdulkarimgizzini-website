<!-- # **PhD Co-Supervision** -->

<h2 style="color: lightblue;">PhD Thesis</h2>
## Student: Abdelhak HEROUCHA

* **Title:** QoE, Explicability and End-to-End trustworthiness among very large heterogeneous IoT Systems: use case of Healthcare applications.
* **Abstract:** The main objective of the thesis is to see how to install original QoE-based functionalities to guarantee trustiness among all domains followed by an IP traffic among several and heterogeneous IoT Healthcare Systems/Domains under 5G/5G Beyond/6G slicing technologies in the context of New IP architectures and to produce prototypes to evaluate our proposals in the case of Very Large Scale Smart Cities and Health situations. These fields are linked with our past studies on Inter-Autonomous Systems Quality of Service (QoS)/Quality of Experience (QoE)-based Routing, Knowledge/Data plan and Control Plan development. In fact, the flexibility and dynamics of the new generation network infrastructure often based on SDN raise important security issues: sensitive data can easily be transferred between different sites, and false knowledge injected at the right time in the network can lead to violation of some constraints. Furthermore, there is a massive and exponential increase in both the number of nodes and in usage. The question that arises is, therefore, how to design a network that can guarantee the satisfaction of all users even in the case of contradictory objectives. How to ensure traceability at all times, and finally, how to guarantee that each component of the system, software or hardware, is a trusted element.

* **Title:** Implementation of an on-board Zero-Touch adaptive and explainable Trustworthiness QoE-centered decision support system for mission-critical operations.
* **Abstract:** The evolution of technologies driven by the significant increase in data exchange capacities with the upcoming arrival of 6G, the numerous applications stemming from IoT, the multiplication of information sources and flows, and the availability of increasingly advanced and diverse devices and accessories, necessitate rethinking decision-support tools. In the field targeted by this thesis, namely video surveillance, administrations, organizations, and security agents in the field and command centers are, and will increasingly be, faced with a considerable amount of information. The ''intelligent'' exploitation of this information could enable disruptive advancements in the effectiveness and efficiency of their missions. This thesis builds on the work carried out by Airbus and the LISSI laboratory, which led to the creation of an initial decision-support platform based on the user experience paradigm (Quality of Experience, QoE). It aims to address new challenges by integrating explainable, adaptive, and frugal artificial intelligence technologies to enhance the effectiveness of video surveillance systems and support field agents. The main objectives of this research include the integration of explainability mechanisms to enable end-users to understand system decisions, thereby strengthening their trust and operational efficiency. The project also seeks to develop a scalable system based on the zero-touch paradigm, capable of learning in real time from new data and responding to unknown situations. By leveraging reinforcement learning, the aim is to optimize an agent's actions in dynamic and uncertain environments, with a deep understanding of the surroundings to maximize long-term performance. Human-machine interaction is studied to design cooperative systems that integrate up-to-date, multi-scale data to optimize decision-making. Additionally, frugal solutions are explored to ensure reliable operation even in the event of disruptions, such as communication losses with the control center. Finally, the integration of Trust QoE will enable the design of a system ensuring a trustworthy user experience by guaranteeing security, reliability, and rapid decision-making, particularly in high-risk situations. This future system will stand out through its ability to support first responders during their missions with accessible visual explanations, continuously adapt to field conditions using data generated by generative AI techniques, and optimize resource management to reduce energy consumption while maintaining high performance levels.
