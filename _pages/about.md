Received my Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering in 2021 from Cergy Paris CY University in France. My master’s and bachelor’s degrees in computer and communication engineering in 2017 and 2015, both from IUL University in Lebanon. I would like to mention that my master's thesis was conducted in collaboration with the Lebanese National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS-L). During 2020, I have been a visiting researcher at Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technical University of Dresden, Germany. Moreover, I have an active research collaboration with the Technical University of Chemnitz - Germany, National Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel) - Brazil, New York University (NYU) - Abu Dhabi, IIndraprastha Institute of Information Technology IIT-Delhi - India, and CNRS - Lebanon. I worked at ENSEA and IMT Nord Europe, France, as a postdoctoral researcher in 2022 and 2023, respectively. My research interests include wireless communications, vehicular communications, channel estimation in doubly dispersive channels, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for wireless communications and image processing. Recently, I joined SogetiLabs, France, as an R&D project manager, where I will be focusing on AI-based solutions for improving the networking performance and QoS.
