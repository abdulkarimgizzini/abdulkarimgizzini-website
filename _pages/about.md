Received my Ph.D. degree in telecommunications engineering in 2021 from Cergy Paris CY University in France. My master’s and bachelor’s degrees in computer and communication engineering in 2017 and 2015, both from IUL university in Lebanon. I would like to mention that my master thesis was conducted in collaboration with the Lebanese National Council for Scientific Research (CNRS-L). During 2020 I have been a visiting researcher at Vodafone Chair Mobile Communications Systems, Technical University of Dresden - Germany. Moreover, I have an active research collaboration with Technical University of Chemnitz - Germany, National Institute of Telecommunications (Inatel) - Brazil, New York University (NYU) - Abu Dhabi, IIndraprastha Institute of Information Technology IIT-Delhi - India, and CNRS - Lebanon. I worked at ENSEA and IMT Nord Europe, France, as a postdoctoral researcher in 2022 and 2023, respectively. After that, I joined SogetiLabs, France, as an R&D project manager where I worked on AI-based solutions for improving the networking performance and QoS. My research interests include wireless communications, vehicular communications, channel estimation in doubly dispersive channels, and explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) for wireless communications, networking, and image processing. Recently, started my new position as an Associate Professor at Université Paris-Est Créteil, Laboratoire Images - Signaux et Systèmes Intelligents (LISSI), TincNET team.
